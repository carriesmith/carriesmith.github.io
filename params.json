{"name":"Carrie Smith","tagline":"A little taste of the projects I've been working on","body":"## Portfolio\r\n\r\n### [The Colours of Monet](http://www.carriesmith.ca/recurse/monet/Process/d3.png)\r\n\r\nAfter a visit to the MOMA I became a little fixated with how one might automatically detect colour palettes from images. I used Python to [scrape a large collection of Monet paintings](http://www.carriesmith.ca/recurse/monet/Process/Colors%20of%20Monet%20-%20Scraping%20Images.html) and [implemented k-nearest-neighbours with some colour correction using Python Imaging Library](http://www.carriesmith.ca/recurse/monet/Process/Colors%20of%20Monet%20-%20Color%20Processing.html) to extract primary colour groups. I completed the project by creating a [data visualization using D3.js](http://www.carriesmith.ca/recurse/monet/Monet.html).\r\n\r\n[![Colors of Monet Screenshot](http://www.carriesmith.ca/recurse/monet/Process/d3.png)](http://www.carriesmith.ca/recurse/monet/Monet.html)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### [Where do Graduates Work?](http://www.carriesmith.ca/HEQCO/college_and_university/dataviz_grads_work.html)\r\n\r\nInspired by [this piece](https://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/stem/stem-html/) by the US Census Bureau, I set out to explore what occupations graduates from various college majors ended up working in. This interactive visualization built in D3 allows the user to explore what fields graduates ended up working in by hovering over a college major (left), and what fields of study occupations draw their employees from by hovering over an occupational category (right). This piece, commissioned by the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario, quickly became one of the most popular blog posts on [HEQCO.ca](http://blog-en.heqco.ca/2015/11/edudata-where-graduates-work/).\r\n\r\n[![Where graduates work data visualization screenshot](http://www.carriesmith.ca/HEQCO/where_graduates_work.png)](http://www.carriesmith.ca/HEQCO/college_and_university/dataviz_grads_work.html)\r\n\r\n<hr>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
