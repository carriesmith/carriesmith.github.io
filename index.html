<p>After a visit to the MOMA I became a fascinated by techniques one might use to extract color palettes from images. I used Python to <a href="http://www.carriesmith.ca/recurse/monet/Process/Colors%20of%20Monet%20-%20Scraping%20Images.html">scrape a large collection of Monet paintings</a> and <a href="http://www.carriesmith.ca/recurse/monet/Process/Colors%20of%20Monet%20-%20Color%20Processing.html">implemented k-nearest-neighbours with some color correction using Python Imaging Library</a> to extract primary color groups. I completed the project by creating a <a href="http://www.carriesmith.ca/recurse/monet/Monet.html">data visualization using D3.js</a>.</p>

</h3>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.census.gov/dataviz/visualizations/stem/stem-html/">this piece</a> by the US Census Bureau, I set out to explore what occupations graduates from various college majors ended up working in. This interactive visualization built in D3 allows the user to explore what fields graduates ended up working in by hovering over a college major (left), and what fields of study occupations draw their employees from by hovering over an occupational category (right). This piece, commissioned by the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario, quickly became one of the most popular blog posts on <a href="http://blog-en.heqco.ca/2015/11/edudata-where-graduates-work/">HEQCO.ca</a>.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought about the optimal number of pairs of underwear to bring on a trip? Not really? I hadn't thought about it much either! But after a fun conversation with a friend who <em>had</em> thought about it (a lot), I was inspired to create this convinient chart. Apparently we weren't the only ones who found this funny, because this post got picked up by <a href="https://flowingdata.com/2014/07/16/how-much-underwear-to-bring-on-a-trip/">Flowing Data<a>, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/how-much-underwear-to-pack-for-your-trip-visualized-1605847840">Gizmodo</a> and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/this-chart-tells-you-exactly-how-much-underwear-you-sho-1606776426">Lifehacker</a> and we ended up with hundreds of thousands of visitors!

  <p>At the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario I acted as technical project lead on a large and innovative study on student time use and time management. For this research project we went mobile for data collection, and I had a hand in everything. I worked on research and UI design, data analysis, QA testing, coordination with our fabulous engineers and synthesizing feedback our steering committee. We celebrated a successful project launch in the Summer of 2015, and data collection will continue over several waves.</p>
